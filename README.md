# VMapper+
Building on the [original VMapper tool](https://github.com/agmip/VMapper), VMapper+ is an annotation service for tabular data that allows the association of each data column with entities defined in controlled knowledge organization systems (KOS).
Entities that can be used for the annotation include [ICASA variables](http://research.agmip.org/display/dev/ICASA+Master+Variable+List), classes defined by ontologies available via the [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) of the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), as well as custom entities defined by the user.
